                    Hello! Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am Elizabeth Tucker, a Junior Web Developer and recent graduate of the University of Texas at Austin's Full-Stack MERN Coding Bootcamp.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Below, you will find a selection of projects I worked on for the course, as well as personal projects (coming soon!)
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Prior to my time at UTA, I worked in Operations and IT for a small import company. I was also an Adult Programming Librarian at the Henry Carter Hull Library in Clinton, Connecticut. I do not have any formal IT training, but my time in both of those positions gave me a wealth of knowledge-- and a number of strategies to seek the answers that I don't have on hand.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Thanks for stopping by! I look forward to hearing from you.
